uBooNE Hackdays scripts and notebooks



## Before the HackDay

Some setup is required before we begin. We're going to be using docker on our laptops. The image that we'll be using is sizeable (~4GB) as well as the data (~20GB).
Therefore, it's best if our work area is setup before the hack day. Bear in mind that it's not necessary to run on laptops, and you might not have sufficient space to run.
